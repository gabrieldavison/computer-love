# computer-love

A work in progress. 

Computer Love is an online zine I created to practice visual design and using the SASS CSS pre-processor. All of the content was generated using easily accessible A.I. sevices. Most pages are finished, I am just waiting for a friend to draw up some illustrations before adding some finishing touches and tidying up the copy.
